# Flying Aircraft Game
I made this game to test my knowledge of Unity and C# which I acquired watching many tutorials. I made this game from scratch. I wanted to create a game like _Flappy Bird_  with something other than a bird. I ended up mainly challenging my ability to create an interactive UI.

# Where to play?
The game is available at: https://nolanbastien.github.io/FlyingAircraftGame/
